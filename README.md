# LOONAMarkov
A Markov chain implementation used to generate new LOONA songs/remixes

There are 2 Markov chain examples here.
Example 1 is a basic chain built only with basic Python and Numpy. 
Example 2 is a basic implementation of Markovify, which unfortunately does not work great with Korean characters, at least in my testing.

Data Set is the lyrics to all the songs in the LOONA albums: ++, XX, #, and 12:00 (this can be found in the corpus.txt)

TO DO:
Have the script better output the chain into "sentences" that are easier to read than 1 singular line.
